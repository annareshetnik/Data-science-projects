| Project  | Description | Skills |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| [Steel temperature prediction](https://github.com/annareshetnik/Data-science-projects/tree/main/steel_temperature_prediction) | Building a ML model to predict steel temperature in a ladle-furnace. The model will help to reduce energy consumption at the stage of steel processing. | Python Pandas Matplotlib NumPy Scikit-learn |
| [Cars price prediction](https://github.com/annareshetnik/Data-science-projects/tree/main/cars_price_prediction) | Building a ML model to predict the cost of the used car. Historical data were used to train the model: technical specifications, equipment and prices of cars.  | Python Pandas Scikit-learn lightgbm  |
|  [Games popularity factors analysis](https://github.com/annareshetnik/Data-science-projects/tree/main/games_popularity_factors_analysis)  |  Identifying the patterns that determine the success of the game. Historical game sales data, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation) were used for analysys.  |  Python Pandas Matplotlib  |
