| File name | Description | Skills |
| ----------- | ----------- |-----------|
| [steel_temperature_prediction](https://github.com/annareshetnik/Data-science-projects/blob/main/steel_temperature_prediction.ipynb) | Building a ML model to predict steel temperature in a ladle-furnace. The model will help to reduce energy consumption at the stage of steel processing.|Python Pandas Matplotlib NumPy Scikit-learn|
| [cars_price_prediction](https://github.com/annareshetnik/Data-science-projects/blob/main/cars_price_prediction.ipynb) | Building a ML model to predict the cost of the used car. Historical data were used to train the model: technical specifications, equipment and prices of cars.|Python Pandas Scikit-learn lightgbm|
| [games_popularity_factors_analysis](https://github.com/annareshetnik/Data-science-projects/blob/main/games_popularity_factors_analysis.ipynb)| Identifying the patterns that determine the success of the game. Historical game sales data, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation) were used for analysys.|Python Pandas Matplotlib|
