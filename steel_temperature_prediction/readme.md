# Steel temperature prediction


## Project description

In order to optimize production costs, the metallurgical plant decided to reduce electricity consumption at the stage of steel processing.



## Purpose of the project

Our goal is to build a ML model that predicts the temperature. The model will help reduce energy consumption at the stage of steel processing, in other words, optimize production costs

## Tools


`Python` `Pandas` `Matplotlib` `NumPy` `Scikit-learn`
